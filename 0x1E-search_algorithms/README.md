# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

This project focuses on implementing various search algorithms in C. The aim is to understand the concepts behind search algorithms, including their space complexity, and to implement them effectively.

## Overview

### Start Date
- **Project Start**: May 20, 2024, 6:00 AM

### End Date
- **Deadline**: May 23, 2024, 6:00 AM

### Checker Release
- **Checker Released**: May 21, 2024, 12:00 AM

### Auto Review
- **Auto Review Launch**: Deadline

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain what a search algorithm is.
- Understand and implement a linear search.
- Understand and implement a binary search.
- Determine the best search algorithm to use based on specific needs.

## Resources

- **Search Algorithm Basics**
- **Space Complexity**
- **Search Algorithms Video Playlist**

## Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- Files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file is mandatory at the root of the project folder.
- Your code should adhere to the Betty style, checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- No global variables.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- Only the `printf` function from the standard library is allowed.
- Main.c files shown as examples are for testing purposes only and should not be pushed to your repo.
- Prototypes of all functions should be included in your header file `search_algos.h`.

### More Info

- Write files containing Big O notations in the specified format:
  - O(1)
  - O(n)
  - O(n!)
  - n*m -> O(nm)
  - n square -> O(n^2)
  - sqrt n -> O(sqrt(n))
  - log(n) -> O(log(n))
  - n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))

## Copyright & Plagiarism

- Solutions must be developed independently to meet the learning objectives.
- Copying and pasting someone elseâ€™s work is strictly prohibited.
- Publishing any content of this project is not allowed.
- Any form of plagiarism will result in removal from the program.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, ensure you have a text editor ready. Plugins for many editors (e.g., Atom, Emacs, Sublime Text, Notepad++, Vim, Visual Studio Code) allow you to preview Markdown while editing. Save the `README.md` file at the root of your project folder.
